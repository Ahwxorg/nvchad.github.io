##  NvChad v2.0 Release Candidate

NvChad `v2.0`, a new release is now available, after all these months! From this release onwards, NvChad will take care about stability & exciting featuers at the same time.

Meaning that each release **( version like v3.0 v4.0 etc )** will be maintained in their own separate branches.  New versions will release based on new features, bug fixes will still be done in older versions of NvChad.

So Whats new in this release?

### Replacing packer.nvim with lazy.nvim

- Lazy.nvim is used as the package manager, replacing packer so obviously it has minor syntax changes.

### Cachifying base46 completely 

- Before base46 used to do some sort of computations like checking for user define highlight groups, highlight groups overrides, theme specific overrides i.e if user has changed colors in specific themes etc and then it would generate a final list of all highlight groups -> then load them.

- Now it base46 does all the computations beforehand ( when its compile module runs ) and then generates highlight group files in the form of bytecode which is faster to run.

- Now you can live-reload some parts of the UI table in chadrc.

## NOTIC To v1.0 users

As there's lazy.nvim being used in this release so this might be a breaking change for you, but dont worry, you can still use old nvchad version and slowly migrate to this one. 

- List of breaking changes are mentioned in this <u>[github issue](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/issues/1809)</u>
