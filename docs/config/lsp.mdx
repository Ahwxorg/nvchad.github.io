## Setup lsp server

- Skim through [lspconfig repo](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) to get a general overview of how the config works.
- Then check [server_configurations.md](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md) to make sure your language's lsp server is present there.


```lua
-- We are just modifying lspconfig's config spec
{
  "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
   config = function()
      require "plugins.configs.lspconfig"
      require "custom.plugins.lspconfig"
   end,
},
```
<br/>

```lua
-- custom.configs.lspconfig
local on_attach = require("plugins.configs.lspconfig").on_attach
local capabilities = require("plugins.configs.lspconfig").capabilities

local lspconfig = require "lspconfig"
local servers = { "html", "cssls", "clangd"}

for _, lsp in ipairs(servers) do
  lspconfig[lsp].setup {
    on_attach = on_attach,
    capabilities = capabilities,
  }
end
```
## Mason.nvim

- The Mason.nvim plugin is used to install lspservers, formatters, linters, and debug adapters. 
- It's better to list all your required packages and put them into your Mason override config.
- Find the exact name of your packages from the `:Mason` window

```lua
 {
   "williamboman/mason.nvim",
   opts = {
      ensure_installed = {
        "lua-language-server",
        "html-lsp",
        "clangd",
        "prettier"
      },
    },
  }
```
<br/>
- Reopen nvim & run the `:MasonInstallAll` command. This will install the listed binaries in the `ensure_installed` table.
- This only downloads the binaries. The lsp server/formatters won't run automatically. You need to configure a custom lspconfig and possibly some plugin like null-ls/neoformat etc for the formatters to work.
