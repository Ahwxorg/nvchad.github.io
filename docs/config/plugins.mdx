## Overview

- NvChad uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for plugins management so its syntax is valid.
- Basically NvChad expects a user plugin table, which then gets merged with the default plugins table.


## Lazy loading

- We lazy load almost 95% of the plugins, so we expect you to lazy load the plugins as well! As its efficient in reducing startuptime. We don't want users making NvChad slow just because they didn't lazy load plugins they've added!

### Tips

- <strong> cmd : </strong> If a plugin loads on commands then use the `cmd` spec, For ex: trouble.nvim plugin opens when we run "Trouble" command, so now I'd just write the word "Trouble" in the cmd spec of trouble.nvim plugin definition.
- <strong> event : </strong> Use this spec if you want to load a plugin on certain vim event ( check :h events ). Cmp.nvim plugin is useful when we're in insert mode, so I lazyload it at "InsertEnter" event. 

- There are more specs through which you could do lazyloading like <strong> ft, cond, keys </strong>.

## Managing custom plugins
- In NvChad (lazy = true) is set to all plugins, so if you want a plugin to be enabled on startup, do (lazy = false)
- Some examples : 

**`custom/chadrc.lua`**  :
```lua
M.plugins = "custom.plugins"
```
<br/>

- Do know you shouldnt save anything in `custom/plugins/` dir. We're using the import feature provided by lazy.nvim so it'll import all the files in a dir and expect each file to return plugin tables etc which we dont want so we just create "custom/plugins.lua" file and then lazy will import only this file.

<br/>

**`custom/plugins.lua`** :
```lua
return {

  -- Install plugin
  { "elkowar/yuck.vim" , lazy = false },

  -- Using more plugin specs like cmd etc
  {
    "Pocco81/TrueZen.nvim",
    cmd = { "TZAtaraxis", "TZMinimalist" },
    config = function()
      require "custom.configs.truezen"
    end,
  }

  -- opts overrides default plugin config's option
  {
    "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter",
    opts = {
      ensure_installed = {"html", "css", "bash"},
    },
  },

  -- Here we wrap opts with a function because its loading cmp module
  -- If we didnt wrap with function then the code will run on startup
   {
    "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp",
    opts = function()
      local cmp = require "cmp"

      return {
        mapping = {
          ["<C-d>"] = cmp.mapping.scroll_docs(-8),
        },
      }
    end,
   },
}
```
