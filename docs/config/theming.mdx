## Override default highlight groups

- Make sure you use a valid highlight group!
- Check your theme colors in this dir:

```shell
~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/base46/lua/base46/integrations
```
<br/>

- In your theme file, for instance onedark.lua, only the variables from base_30 can be used in overriding your custom highlight groups. 
- You can even use hex colors in the fg/bg field, but it's preferable to use variable names (for instance: blue, darker_black, one_bg, etc.) from your theme file as these will look better.
- No need to write hex colors manually!

```lua
M.ui = {
   hl_override = {
      Pmenu = { bg = "white" },
      -- Pmenu = { bg = "#ffffff" }, this works too


      MyHighlightGroup = {
         fg = "red",
         bg = "darker_black"
      }
   },
}
```

### Add new highlight groups

- The same method can be used as above, but instead of `hl_override`, you add in `hl_add` field in chadrc.

## Customize themes

- You can edit theme colors from the `changed_themes` table
```lua
M.ui = {

   changed_themes = {
      onedark = {
         base_16 = {
            base00 = "#mycol",
         },
         base_30 = {
            red = "#mycol",
            white = "#mycol",
         },
      },

      nord = {
         -- and so on!
      },
   },
}
```

### Local themes

(WARNING: Do this at your own risk because you might not be able to make nvchad themes like siduck.)
- Default themes are in our base46 repo's themes dir.
- Any nvchad theme structure looks like this:

```lua
-- theme file is custom/themes/siduck.lua

local M = {}

M.base_30 = {
    -- my colors
}

M.base_16 = {
    -- my base16 colors
}

vim.opt.bg = "dark" -- or light 
return M
```

<br/>
- Make sure to use the exact variable names!

```lua
M.ui = {
   theme = "siduck",
}
```
