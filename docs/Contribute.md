To contribute, the biggest thing you need is your own fork & `stylua`
- [Stylua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua)
- [Github forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
- [Github forking & setting upstream](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-forks-and-upstreams)
-- Please use the **`--rebase`** flag when updating your branch for contributions
```
git pull upstream main --rebase
```
- This will avoid redundant merge commits
- When making a PR (pull request), please be very descriptive in what you've done!
- We are open to all PRs, but may decline some for a myriad of reasons. Though don't be discouraged! We'll still be open to discussions.
