## If you're new to Neovim/Vim

We strongly encourage you to learn how to use Neovim/Vim. If you are totally new to Vim then you cannot use NvChad until you gain some basic knowledge about Vim's modes, default editor commands, and key bindings.

These are highly recommended and a must do for any new Vimmer:

- Vim tutor

## Setup custom config

- NvChad updates won't overwite the `lua/custom` dir as it's gitignored and all of the user changes must be done in this dir only.
- [Minimal custom config](https://github.com/NvChad/example_config) : This is a good starting point and can be taken as an example.
- Go through it and setup treesitter parsers, mason binaries, lspconfig etc. 
- Chadrc is just meant to override `core/default_config.lua` file, check what all options are available!

## Nvim lua

- You should know how to convert a vimscript code into lua for your config.
- Read the official [documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html#lua-guide) for this.

## Read NvChad docs

- Now you have to read nvchad docs in order ( from here ) in order to use nvchad properly, I'll try to keep it as short as possible.
