import OS_Selector from "../../src/components/docpage/install.tsx";

## Pre-requisites

- [Neovim 0.8.3](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.8.0).
- [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) Set it in your terminal emulator.
  - Make sure the nerd font you set doesnt end with <strong>Mono</strong> 
   - <strong>Example : </strong> Iosevka Nerd Font and not <s>Iosevka Nerd Font Mono</s>
   - Thats because those fonts will have small icons.
- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is required for grep searching with Telescope <strong>(OPTIONAL)</strong>. 
- GCC 
- Windows users must have [`mingw`](http://mingw-w64.org/downloads) installed and set on path.
- Delete old neovim dir ( check commands below to do it )

## Update

NvChad has an update mechanism built-in, which will pull any new updates from the git repository.

- Update NvChad by pressing `<leader> + uu`
- **Note**: by NvChad default, `<leader>` is the `<space>` key.

# linux/macos (unix)
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
rm -rf ~/.cache/nvim

# windows
rd -r ~\AppData\Local\nvim
