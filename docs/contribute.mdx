## NvChad install for contributors

If you wish to contribute to NvChad, you should:

1. [Create a fork on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
2. Clone the fork to your machine:
  - For ssh:
    ```shell
    $ git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/NvChad.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```
  - For https:
    ```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/NvChad.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```
3. [Add a new remote repo to track](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-forks-and-upstreams)
   - This means you can push/pull as usual to your own repo, but also easily track and update from the NvChad repository.
    - For ssh:
       ```shell
       $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:NvChad/NvChad.git
       ```
    - For https:
       ```shell
       $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad.git
       ```  
4. Any time you create a branch to do some work, use:
   ```shell
   $ git fetch upstream && git checkout -b dev-myFEAT upstream/main
   ```
5. Only use the **--rebase** flag to update your dev branch:
   - This means that there are no `Merge NvChad/main into devBranch` commits, which are to be avoided.
   ```shell
   $ git pull upstream --rebase
   ```

## Things to know before contributing

- When making a PR (pull request), please be very descriptive about what you've done. 

- We are open to all PRs, but may decline some for a myriad of reasons. Don't be discouraged, though! We're still open to discussion.

- PR's are always welcome; however, NvChad aims to be less bloated. So PR's regarding an existing plugin's enhancement and creating new features with existing plugins itself (without adding a new plugin), bug fixes, and corrections are more encouraged.

- NvChad won't keep adding more and more features (like adding new plugins) as requested if they feel unneeded and aren't usable by the majority. If you think the plugin you want to be added is very useful and many NvChaders would find it useful, then such PR's are welcome. 

- Adding specific features, like adding config for [wakatime](https://github.com/wakatime/vim-wakatime) will be added in this [chad user configs](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad/wiki/Chad-user-configs). This lets the user select the things only they want (adding configs from extra configs).
